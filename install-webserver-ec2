Install a Web Server on EC2
Apache HTTP Server (httpd) is a widely used web server that serves HTML files and content over the internet. Installing it on Linux EC2 server allows you to host MarketPeak E-
commerce site:
Install Apache web server on the EC2 instance. Note that httpd is the software name for Apache on systems using yum package manager

sudo yum update -y
sudo yum install httpd -y
sudo systemctl start httpd
sudo systemctl enable httpd

This first updates the linux server and then installs httpd (Apache), starts the web server, and ensures it automatically starts on server boot.

Configure httpd for Website
To serve the website from the EC2 instance, configure httpd to point to the directory on the Linux server where the website code files are stored. Usually in /var/www html.

Prepare the Web Directory: Clear the default httpd web directory and copy MarketPeak Ecommerce website files to it.

sudo rm -rf /var/www/html/_
sudo cp -r ~/MarketPeak_Ecommerce/_ /var/www/html/

The directory /var/www/html/is a standard directory structure on Linux systems that host web content, particularly for the Apache HTTP Server.

When you install Apache on a Linux system, the installation process automatically creates this directory. It's designated as the default document root in Apache's configuration,
meaning that Apache is set up to serve web files (such as HTML, CSS, and JavaScript files) located in this directory to visitors of your website,

Reload httpd: Apply the changes by reloading the httpd service.
sudo systemctl reload httpd

sudo systemctl reload httpd

Access Website from Browser
With httpd configured and website files in place, MarketPeak Ecommerce platform is now live on the internet:
Open a web browser and access the public IP of your EC2 instance to view the deployed website.
